# Address tangible risks with the Govern methodology of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

Without proper governance, it can be difficult and laborious to maintain consistent control across a portfolio of workloads. Fortunately, cloud-native tools like Azure Policy and Azure Blueprints provide convenient means to establish those controls. The Govern methodology helps you evaluate and establish corporate policies and disciplines to mitigate tangible risks.
