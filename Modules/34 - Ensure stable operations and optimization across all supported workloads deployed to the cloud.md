# Ensure stable operations and optimization across all supported workloads deployed to the cloud

As workloads are deployed to the cloud, operations are critical to success. In this learn module, you learn how to deploy an operations baseline to manage workloads in your environment. The module also covers how to enhance the baseline, both for workloads and for platforms.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Evaluate levels of business commitment across your portfolio of workloads
- Deploy an operations baseline
- Customize the baseline to meet operations needs
- Centralize operations for core platforms
- Partner with workload teams for richer decentralized operations
